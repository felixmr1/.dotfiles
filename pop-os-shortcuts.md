# Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS Keyboard Shortcuts

> **Note:** When keys are shown in backticks like `S` or `H`, this refers to the lowercase letter key, not uppercase. When `Shift` is required, it will be explicitly specified in the shortcut (e.g., `Shift` + `S`).

## Super Key

The Super key is the OS key on your keyboard.

- On recent System76 products, it's between the `Fn` and the `Alt` keys. The key is labelled with a rectangle and two vertical lines, one on either side of the rectangle.
- On older System76 products, the Super key is between the `Fn` and the `Alt` keys and is represented by the Ubuntu logo.
- On the Launch keyboard it is the `SUPER` key.
- On generic third-party products, it may be labeled with a Windows logo.
- On Mac accessories, it may be labeled `command`.

In Pop!_OS, the Super key handles the majority of OS and window actions. This key is represented by `SUPER` in the lists below.
